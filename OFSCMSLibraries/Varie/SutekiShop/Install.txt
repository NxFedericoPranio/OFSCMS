Installing Suteki Shop
----------------------

Pre-requisites:
1. .NET 4.0
2. MVC 2.0
3. SQL Server 8
4. IIS 7+

INPUT_DIR refers to the WebApplication directory supplied along with this file.
TARGET_DIR refers to the directory the application will live in on your server.
DB_CREATOR refers to the DbCreator directory supplied along with this file.

This document assumes that you have at least basic knowledge about managing a Windows Server
machine and IIS (Internet Information Services).

 1. Create TARGET_DIR if it does not already exist; be sure that the directory is empty.

 2. Copy all the files from INPUT_DIR into TARGET_DIR.

 3. If you have a local SQL Server database which you have administration rights to, you can skip this step. 
    Otherwise:
  - Change the SutekiShop connection string in the Web.config file in TARGET_DIR and the 
    Suteki.Shop.CreateDb.exe.config file in the DB_CREATOR directory for your database.
    Remember that the web.config connection string will need to have datareader and datawriter rights on your
    SQL Server instance.

 4. Run the Suteki.Shop.CreateDb.exe executable in the DB_CREATOR directory. This will create the SutekiShop database.

 5. Set the permissions of the TARGET_DIR directory so that the ASP.NET Worker Process has read and modify 
    permissions on it (usually, the ASP.NET Worker Process runs as "NETWORK SERVICE" or "ASPNET", 
    depending on the Operating System version).

 6. Setup a Web Site or Application in IIS, setting the root directory to TARGET_DIRECTORY.

 7. Navigate to the Web Site or Application using a web browser and verify that everything works properly.

 8. Login using "admin@sutekishop.co.uk" and password "admin" to create categories and products. 
    Note, you should change this password before putting your shop into production.
